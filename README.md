# Task 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Objective
To understand data patterns, distributions, relationships, and important features using visualization techniques.

## Datasets Used
- Netflix Movies and TV Shows
- Iris Dataset

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## EDA Steps Performed
- Distribution analysis using histograms
- Categorical analysis using count plots
- Outlier detection using box plots
- Correlation analysis using heatmaps

## Key Insights
- Netflix has more Movies than TV Shows
- Most Netflix content is released after 2015
- Iris dataset shows strong correlation between petal length and petal width
- Petal features are most important for Iris classification

## Conclusion
EDA helped in understanding feature behavior, detecting outliers, and identifying important features for prediction.
